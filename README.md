## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- API keys for OpenAI and/or Anthropic (optional, but recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/terrafusion/ai-platform.git
   cd ai-platform
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up environment variables for API keys:
   ```
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_anthropic_api_key"
   ```

### Running the Platform

Launch the application:
```
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:5000

## Usage

### Main Dashboard

The main dashboard provides an overview of system performance, AI service status, and access to all specialized tools.

### Analyzing Code

1. Navigate to the Code Analysis dashboard
2. Upload a file or paste code directly
3. Select the type of analysis (quality, architecture, performance, security)
4. Choose your preferred AI provider
5. View detailed analysis results and recommendations

### Optimizing Workflows

1. Navigate to the Workflow Visualization dashboard
2. Import or create a workflow diagram
3. Analyze for bottlenecks and inefficiencies
4. View optimization suggestions
5. Export optimized workflow

## AI Integration

The platform integrates with both OpenAI and Anthropic models:

- **OpenAI:** Utilizes GPT-4o for advanced code analysis and generation
- **Anthropic:** Leverages Claude 3.5 for additional insights and perspectives

The `ModelInterface` class provides a unified API for both providers, allowing seamless switching between models and fallback options if one provider is unavailable.

## Architecture

The platform follows a modular architecture:

- **Core Services:** Foundational services for AI integration and basic functionality
- **Specialized Modules:** Purpose-built modules for specific analysis tasks
- **UI Components:** Streamlit-based UI for interactive user experience
- **Agent Framework:** Infrastructure for multi-agent coordination and communication

# ⚙️ Update `app.py` to Show Suggestions

Add this into your Streamlit `app.py` after the Phase Tracker section:

```python
from task_suggestion_agent import suggest_next_tasks

st.header("🧠 Task Suggestion Engine")

suggested_tasks = suggest_next_tasks(st.session_state["phases"])

for task in suggested_tasks:
    st.write(f"- {task}")
```

# ✨ How It Works (Simple Tactical Flow)

```plaintext
1. User completes a phase
2. Phase Manager saves progress
3. Task Suggestion Agent reads phase state
4. Suggests high-priority next tasks based on current progress
5. User sees actionable suggestions live in dashboard
```

✅ No fancy external API needed yet.  
✅ Instant visibility of next best moves.  
✅ Auto-adjusts suggestions as you move forward in your project.

# 📈 Visual Example in Dashboard

| Phase | Suggested Tasks |
|:---|:---|
| Development (active) | Scaffold plugins, write tests, set up GraphQL gateway |
| Testing (active) | Execute integration tests, static security scans |
| Post-Deployment (active) | Collect user feedback, generate post-mortem reports |

# 🚀 Immediate Advantages You Now Have:

| Benefit | Impact |
|:---|:---|
| 📋 Clearer sprint/phase execution | Less planning time wasted |
| 🧠 Local "brain" to steer the mission | No outside dependency or subscription needed |
| 📈 Tighter feedback loop | Faster iterations, better outcomes |
